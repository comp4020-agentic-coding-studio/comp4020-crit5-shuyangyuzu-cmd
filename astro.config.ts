// Written by the course stack skill; values derived from this repo's origin
// remote. The dev server serves under the base too, so a path bug reproduces
// locally instead of only on the live URL. build.format "preserve" maps each
// page to the same output path it had before the conversion --- about.html
// stays /about.html and notes/index.html stays /notes/index.html --- so
// hand-written relative links and asset paths keep working. Astro's default
// ("directory") would move every root page to /about/, and "file" would
// collapse notes/index.html to /notes.html; either way half the pages get a
// URL one level off from the one their relative links were written against.
// compressHTML true because the default ("jsx") strips the space before
// line-broken inline elements in hand-written prose.
